# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a React-based application (likely using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and PostgreSQL based on configuration files present).

## React Development Guidelines

When working with React components in this codebase:

- Use functional components with hooks instead of class components
- Use custom hooks for reusable logic
- Use the Context API for state management when needed
- Use proper prop validation with PropTypes
- Use React.memo for performance optimization when necessary
- Use fragments to avoid unnecessary DOM elements
- Use proper list rendering with keys
- Prefer composition over inheritance

These rules apply to all .jsx and .tsx files in the project.

## Tech Stack (Planned)

- **Frontend Framework**: React (with Next.js)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: PostgreSQL

Note: The project structure is still being initialized. Commands for building, testing, and running the application will be added as the project develops.
